description: Use together with Plan Mode to improve planning quality by forcing assumption listing, gap detection, and clarification before implementation.

# Purpose

This skill enhances Plan Mode by ensuring deeper analysis before implementation.

It prevents shallow planning and forces the model to identify missing details and uncertainties.

# Behavior

When used alongside Plan Mode:

Before finalizing any plan or moving to implementation, the model must:

1. List assumptions being made
2. Identify missing constraints or unclear areas
3. Highlight potential risks or edge cases
4. Ask clarification questions if needed

# Constraints

- Do not skip assumption listing
- Do not proceed directly to implementation if important uncertainties exist
- Prefer asking questions over making unsupported assumptions

# Output Style

Before presenting the final plan, include:

- Assumptions
- Missing / Unclear Areas
- Risks / Edge Cases
- Clarification Questions (if needed)

Then proceed with the plan ONLY if sufficient clarity is achieved.
